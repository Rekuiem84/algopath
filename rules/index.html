    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <p><b>Number of players :</b> 1 - 4</p>
    <p><b>Game time :</b> at least 5 minutes for each level</p>
    <p><b>Equipments :</b> the game board, at least one whiteboard marker, a character, a flag, 3 monster tokens, 3 coin
      tokens, 30 variable tokens, 20 orange action cards, 16 green action cards, 6 blue action cards, 4 red action cards
    </p>
    <p class="title">Setup :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Place the board at the center of the table, with a pile of cards for each action (move forward, turn, repeat,
        attack) next to it.</li>
      <li>
        Scan the QR code on the board to access the app, you will enter all the players' names to keep track of the
        points, and will be asked questions for the quiz.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select a level blueprint on the app and replicate it on the board using the marker, place the character and the
        flag on the board as well. If you have some monster and coin tokens, place them in their designated squares, if
        you don't have any, you can draw them using a marker.
      </li>
      <li>Choose a game mode on the app : speedrun mode, or greedy mode.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="title">How to play :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The player who owns the phone will play first, and the game plays clockwisely (same way a clock hand turns).
      </li>
      <li><b>Select a question :</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>blue questions are easier but only give one action card,</li>
        <li>red questions are harder but give two action cards.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        If the player answers correctly to the question, they can draw one card, and one additional card if the question
        was red.
      </li>
      <li><b>Then, the player can either :</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>end their turn, and the player on their left can start their turn,</li>
        <li>submit their algorithm to reach the flag</li>
      </ul>
      <li>If a player successfully reaches the flag, they earn 3 points and the board can be wiped to start a new level.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="title">How to submit the algorithm :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The current player gets to choose which way the character faces when starting his algorithm.</li>
      <li>The current player places their action cards next to the board, from top to bottom, in order, so that the
        actions make
        the character reach the flag. The actions are read from top to bottom, from left to right. The current player is
        free to
        use as many variable tokens as they need.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="title">How to win :</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>In speedrun mode :</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Be the first to reach the flag 5 times to win. Once a player reaches the flag, the board is wiped and a new
          level can be
          drawn on the board.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>In greedy mode :</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Be the first to reach 20 points to win.</li>
        <li>Points chart :</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Reaching the flag : 3 points</li>
          <li>Beating a monster : 2 points</li>
          <li>Collecting a coin : 1 point</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Specific actions :</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>To beat a monster, you have to use an attack action card, facing the monster</li>
          <li>To collection a coin, the character has to walk on the coin tile</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p class="title">Action cards :</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Orange cards :</b> move N blocks forward, where N is the variable token</li>
      <li><b>Green cards :</b> rotate N degrees to the right, where N is the variable token (N can only be 90, 180, or
        270)
      </li>
      <li><b>Blue cards :</b> repeat block N times, where N is the variable token</li>
      <ul>
        <li>the block is the group of action cards under this card, you have to indent your block to the right for it to
          be repeated (see example below)</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Red cards :</b> attack the tile in front of the character</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note"><b>Note :</b> players can only submit their algorithm during their turn</p>
    <p class="note"><b>Note :</b> the character can never pass a wall, even if it has remaining steps to move. In this
      case, the character stops moving forward and the next action card is triggered</p>
    <p class="note"><b>Tip :</b> turning 270 degrees to the right is the same as turning 90 degrees to the left</p>
    <p class="note"><b>About the repeat action card :</b> </p>
    <div class="img-cont"><img src="../assets/images/example-1.png" alt="example"></div>
    <p>This algorithm uses a <b>repeat card</b>, the indented cards will be executed as many times as written the
      variable token on the repeat card</p>
    <p>This algorithm above would be the same as the one below</p>
